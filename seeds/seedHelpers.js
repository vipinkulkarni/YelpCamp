    'This was a great campground to go to. The staff here were very friendly and make sure that we were happy with our stay.  The restrooms and showers were very nice. Family enjoyed our stay here.',
    "Great customer service, they have a park for children, swings, slides, the restrooms and showers are very clean and very nice a big + in my book! You are right off the highway a mile away from wally world so its very convenient and easy to get to. New bbq pits, fire pit, all your hook ups and everything you need they got it. Also a outdoor pool.",
    "Great experience. Great service. Bathrooms A+++ very clean, would recommend. Smaller grass area for lots but still great amenities. Pool and park nice as well.",
    "Brand new beautiful park with friendly staff. Big dog park is a plus and very clean.  sites are big compared to other places with a very nice patio.   The view is pretty awesome too!",
    "Just 3/4 of a mile from I-70; we are a quiet oasis of trees, flowers and grass in Western Kansas! This award-winning KOA is an oasis of green lawns and mature shade trees less than a mile from I-70. It's a great place to refresh and regroup! After a long day on the road, take a dip in the pool or just enjoy the abundant flowers. You'll find 30/50-amp, full-hookup Pull-Thru RV Sites, Back-In RV Sites, basic water and electric sites and Tent Sites. Or try a Cabin with A/C for hot summer days! Free Wi-Fi offered throughout the park. Goodland's High Plains Museum contains a replica of America's first patented helicopter, built by two local men in 1909.",
    "Rest your road-weary bones at this quiet country setting. It's the nearest KOA to beautiful Kentucky Lake and its 2,380 miles of shoreline, offering endless fun, boating and fishing. Welcome to western Kentucky! Enjoy the beautiful rolling terrain, four major rivers and two large lakes with all the amenities. This KOA's location was chosen with the lakes in mind - and all the fun things to do in the area. Only 1.25 miles from I-24, this is the KOA closest to Kentucky Lake (2,380 miles of shoreline) and the entrance to Land Between The Lakes. You're just minutes away from several great golf courses, as well as antique shops and flea markets. Enjoy real Southern barbecue and some of the world's best catfish and hush puppies.",
    "Hidden gem. This free camp is top notch! Recommend. Pick up your trash and respect it so everyone can come enjoy it.",
    "Love this beautiful coastal state park! Try for a sunny site in the front of the park or you might not ever see the sun in the forested part of the campground. Small beach across the road from the park has a kayak rental business most days, amazing sea caves are right off the shore!"
